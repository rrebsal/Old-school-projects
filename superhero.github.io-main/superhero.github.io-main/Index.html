    <p> The Scarlet Witch (also known as Wanda Maximoff) is a character in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) who has destructive magic called "Chaos magic". She was introduced as a villain in the first movie she appeared in, but later joined the good forces to protect her home country, Sokovia. But then later in the story, she ends up losing her children and husband, and this drives her to insanity. She started studying dark magic, in hopes of finding a way to get his children and maybe even his husband back, which made her go against the people she had fought aside with, just so she'd have a chance to see her family again.
